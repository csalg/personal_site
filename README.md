### Development notes

* This version of `gatsby` doesn't seem to like the newer versions of `node`; apparently it's some issue to do with the webpack version. So `nvm use 14`.
* To install `npm install`. If there are some errors then `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` and try again.
* Then to develop `gatsby develop`.
